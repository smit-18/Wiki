# Wiki

Wiki is a smaller version of the wikipedia, it is made using Django framework. 

These are the basic operations which the wiki web application allows you to do:

* Create new pages filled with information in the form of a .md (markdown) file.
* Edit those created files.
* You can view and access all the pages from the mainpage of the application.
* You can search for the pages as well.
